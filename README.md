A fun beginner Python project that uses variables, booleans, and comparison operators to decide if my outfit is good for the day! Made while learning Python basics like variables, True/False, and == or !=.
# Outfit Checker 👗👟

This is a fun beginner Python project where I use variables, booleans, and comparison operators to check if my outfit is ready for the day. It prints out results based on basic logic using `==`, `!=`, `True`, `False`, and `not`.

## 💡 What I Learned
- Using and understanding variables
- Boolean values like `True` and `False`
- Equality and inequality operators (`==`, `!=`)
- Logical thinking in code

## 📁 About This Project
This project doesn't take user input — it just uses simple variables and prints results based on conditions. It's made to show my progress as I learn Python step-by-step.

## 🚀 What's Next
As I learn more (like taking input and loops), I'll update this project or make new ones and upload them here!
